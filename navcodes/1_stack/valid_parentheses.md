# 📘 Valid Parentheses Problem

## Problem Statement
We need to check whether a string of brackets `()[]{}` is **valid**.  
A string is valid if:  
1. Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.  
2. Brackets are closed in the correct order (no crossing).  
3. No unmatched or leftover brackets remain at the end.

## Full Code Reference
```python
class ValidParentheses:
    def solution(self, s):
        stack = []
        close_to_open_map = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

        for ch in s:
            if ch in close_to_open_map: 
                if stack and stack[-1] == close_to_open_map[ch]:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                stack.append(ch)  # FIXED: previously missing argument
        
        return not stack

## Step-by-Step Explanation (Pattern in English)

1. **Stack as memory**

   * We use a **stack** to keep track of all the **opening brackets**.
   * Whenever we see an opening bracket `(`, `{`, `[`, we **push** it onto the stack.

2. **Mapping for quick lookup**

   * A dictionary maps closing brackets to their matching opening ones:

     ```python
     {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
     ```
   * This allows **constant-time checking** when we meet a closing bracket.

3. **Iterate through characters**

   * For each character:

     * **If it’s a closing bracket:**

       * Check if stack is not empty **AND** the top matches.
       * If yes → pop the top (valid match).
       * If no → return `False` immediately (mismatch).
     * **If it’s an opening bracket:** push it onto the stack.

4. **Final check**

   * At the end, if the stack is **empty**, then every opening bracket was matched → return `True`.
   * If the stack still has items, some brackets were never closed → return `False`.

## Example Walkthroughs

### Example 1: Input = `"()[]{}"`

* Push `(` → stack = \["("]
* See `)` → matches `(` → pop → stack = \[]
* Push `[` → stack = \["\["]
* See `]` → matches `[` → pop → stack = \[]
* Push `{` → stack = \["{"]
* See `}` → matches `{` → pop → stack = \[]
* Stack empty → return `True` ✅

### Example 2: Input = `"([)]"`

* Push `(` → stack = \["("]
* Push `[` → stack = \["(", "\["]
* See `)` → expected `(`, but top is `[` → mismatch → return `False` ❌

### Example 3: Input = `"((("`

* Push `(` → stack = \["("]
* Push `(` → stack = \["(", "("]
* Push `(` → stack = \["(", "(", "("]
* End of string → stack not empty → return `False` ❌

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use a **stack** when the problem involves “last opened, first closed” patterns.
* Use a **dictionary mapping** for easy and scalable matching logic.
* Always check if the stack is **non-empty before peeking**.
* Return early when a mismatch is found (fail fast).
* Keep the solution concise and avoid deeply nested `if` statements.

## 🚀 Possible Extensions

1. **Add `< >` brackets** to mapping.

   ```python
   close_to_open_map = {")":"(", "}":"{", "]":"[", ">":"<"}
   ```

2. **Skip non-bracket characters** (e.g., validate `"a+(b*c)"`).

3. **Return index of first error** for better debugging instead of just `False`.

4. **Custom Exception Handling**

   ```python
   class InvalidExpressionError(Exception):
       pass
   ```

5. **Apply pattern to HTML/XML tag validation** (replace single characters with full tags).
