# 📘 @notes: Valid Palindrome Problem

---

## 🔹 What the code does

* Checks if a given string is a **palindrome** (same forwards and backwards).
* Ignores **non-alphanumeric characters** and is **case-insensitive**.

---

## 🔹 Two Approaches

### **1. Two-Pointer Approach**

```python
def isPalindromeTwoPointers(self, s):
    l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
    while l < r:
        while l < r and not self.alphaNum(s[l]):
            l += 1
        while l < r and not self.alphaNum(s[r]):
            r -= 1
        if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
            return False
        l, r = l + 1, r - 1
    return True
```

**Logic:**

1. Initialize two pointers: `l` (start), `r` (end).
2. Skip over non-alphanumeric chars using `alphaNum`.
3. Compare characters at `l` and `r` (in lowercase).

   * If mismatch → return `False`.
   * Else → move inward.
4. If loop completes, return `True`.

### **2. Simple String-Build + Reverse**

```python
def simpleIsPalindrome(self, s):
    newStr = ''
    for c in s:
        if c.isalnum():
            newStr += c.lower()
    return newStr == newStr[::-1]
```

**Logic:**

1. Build a cleaned string containing only lowercase alphanumeric chars.
2. Compare the string with its reverse (`[::-1]`).
3. If equal → palindrome, else → not.

---

## 🔹 Data Structure / Pattern

* **Two Pointers** (common interview pattern).
* **String cleaning + reverse** (straightforward, uses Python slicing).
* Both rely on checking **symmetry** in strings.

---

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

`s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`

* **Two Pointers:** Compare progressively:

  * `A` vs `a` ✅, `m` vs `m` ✅, … till end.
* **Simple:** Clean to `"amanaplanacanalpanama"` → compare with reverse → ✅ same.

## 🔹 Complexity

| Approach             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Two-Pointer**      | O(n)            | O(1)             | In-place, best for large inputs        |
| **String + Reverse** | O(n)            | O(n)             | Needs extra string for cleaned version |

---

## 🔹 Which Method is Better?

* **Two-Pointer is better in interviews and large data cases** because:

  1. Uses **O(1) extra space** (just pointers).
  2. Does not require building an extra string.
  3. Matches the “classic interview pattern” → **Two Pointers**.

* **Simple Method is better for quick coding** (LeetCode submissions, scripts) because:

  1. Very short and readable.
  2. Python slicing makes reverse check trivial.

👉 **Interview Answer:** Prefer **Two-Pointer** for efficiency and demonstrating algorithmic thinking.
👉 **Practical quick code:** The simple method is perfectly fine.

## 🔹 How to Remember

* "When comparing symmetry in strings/lists → **Two Pointers**."
* "When coding quick in Python → clean string + reverse."
* Always think: **O(1) space vs O(n) space tradeoff**.
