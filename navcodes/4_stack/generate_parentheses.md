## 🧩 Problem: Generate Parentheses

You are given an integer `n`.
Return **all possible well-formed parentheses combinations** that can be made using `n` pairs of parentheses.

---

## 🧠 Problem Understanding

### Example:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

### Valid means:

* Every `(` must be closed by a matching `)` after it.
* You can **never** have more `)` than `(` at any point.
* Total number of `(` and `)` must both be `n`.

---

## ⚙️ Code

```python
def generate_parentheses(n):
    result = []

    def backtrack(current, open_count, close_count):
        # Base case: when all parentheses are used
        if len(current) == 2 * n:
            result.append("".join(current))
            return

        # Option 1: Add "(" if we still have some left
        if open_count < n:
            current.append("(")
            backtrack(current, open_count + 1, close_count)
            current.pop()  # undo the move

        # Option 2: Add ")" if it won't break balance
        if close_count < open_count:
            current.append(")")
            backtrack(current, open_count, close_count + 1)
            current.pop()  # undo the move

    backtrack([], 0, 0)
    return result
```

## 🧩 Step-by-step Explanation

We start with an empty string and make **choices** at every step:

* Add `"("` if we haven’t used all of them.
* Add `")"` if it won’t make the sequence invalid.

When the current string’s length = `2 * n`,
we know we’ve used all parentheses → save that string.

### Why we append and pop:

* **append()** → “try adding this character”
* **pop()** → “undo it and try something else”

This try → explore → undo pattern is called **backtracking**.
It’s how we explore *all possible valid combinations* without repetition.

---

## 🧱 Key Idea (Intuition)

You’re **building a string step by step**, following two simple rules:

1. You can only open new brackets up to `n` times.
2. You can only close when there’s something open.

So you explore **all valid paths** that follow those rules.

Each time you reach the end (2*n length), you found one valid combination.

## 🧠 Pattern Identification

### 🧩 Core Pattern:

**Backtracking (DFS) + Constraint-based Generation**

You’re exploring a **decision tree** of all possible states.
Each state = (`open_count`, `close_count`, current_string).

### ⚡ How to recognize this pattern next time:

| Clue in question                         | Think “Backtracking” if…                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| “Return all valid combinations”          | You must generate *all*, not just count          |
| “Follow certain rules or constraints”    | You can prune invalid states early               |
| “Small n (≤10)”                          | The space is exponential, intended for recursion |
| “Open/close / choose/unchoose decisions” | Perfect for recursive exploration                |

## 🧠 Tips to Recognize Pattern Over Time

1. If problem says **“generate all”** → think recursion/backtracking.
2. If result depends on **sequences or order**, not just numbers → think DFS.
3. If there’s a **valid/invalid rule** (like “must be balanced”) → think pruning during recursion.
4. If `n` is small but output count is big → that’s a hint it’s enumerating all possibilities.

## 🧩 Complexity Analysis

| Type      | Complexity  | Explanation                                           |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**  | `O(Cn * n)` | `Cn` = nth Catalan number (number of valid sequences) |
| **Space** | `O(n)`      | Max recursion depth (plus output storage)             |

For `n = 7`, it’s fine (Catalan(7) = 429).

## 🧠 Pattern Memory Cue (ADHD Hack)

> “If I’m generating all valid sequences under rules — it’s backtracking.”
> You’re not looping through everything; you’re **exploring possibilities smartly** and **undoing wrong turns**.

Would you like me to now make a **visual recursion tree diagram** 🌳 (for `n=3`) showing how each combination like `((()))`, `(()())`, etc. are formed step-by-step?
That visual makes the “different combinations” part *click instantly*.
