# 🧩 Add Two Numbers

You’re given two linked lists:

```
l1 = [2,4,3]   # represents 342
l2 = [5,6,4]   # represents 465
```

We need to add them → `342 + 465 = 807` → return `[7,0,8]`.

Numbers are **stored in reverse order**, so you add from head first.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Think like addition

```
342
+465
-----
 807
```

We start from **least significant digit**,
which is **already the head** in the linked list.

That means we can just move forward, adding nodes one by one.

# 🧩 Non-Recursive (Iterative) Solution — “loop style”

This is the one you already know — simple, efficient, and readable.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def add_two_numbers_iterative(l1, l2):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    tail = dummy
    carry = 0

    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
        val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
        total = val1 + val2 + carry

        carry = total // 10
        digit = total % 10
        tail.next = ListNode(digit)
        tail = tail.next

        # Move ahead in both lists
        if l1: l1 = l1.next
        if l2: l2 = l2.next

    return dummy.next
```

---

# 🔁 Recursion version — “thinking like the computer”

Now, think recursively.
Each function call should:

1. Add the current digits (`l1.val + l2.val + carry`)
2. Create a new node with the **ones** place
3. Call itself for the **next** digits, passing the **carry**

And it should return the **head node** of the sum list.

---

## ✨ Recursive Visualization

At each step:

```
add(l1=2, l2=5, carry=0)
→ total = 7 → node(7)
→ node.next = add(l1=4, l2=6, carry=0)
```

and so on, until both lists are done and no carry left.

---

## 🧠 Recursive code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def add_two_numbers_recursive(l1, l2, carry=0):
    # Base case — if both lists are empty and no carry
    if not l1 and not l2 and carry == 0:
        return None

    # Get values or 0 if node is missing
    val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
    val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
    total = val1 + val2 + carry

    # Create node for the current digit
    new_node = ListNode(total % 10)

    # Recursive call for next digits
    next_l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
    next_l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
    new_node.next = add_two_numbers_recursive(next_l1, next_l2, total // 10)

    return new_node
```

---

## 🧩 Let’s visualize recursion for l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

### Step 1:

`add_two_numbers_recursive(2,5,0)`
→ total = 7 → node = 7
→ next = add(4,6,0)

### Step 2:

`add_two_numbers_recursive(4,6,0)`
→ total = 10 → node = 0 → carry = 1
→ next = add(3,4,1)

### Step 3:

`add_two_numbers_recursive(3,4,1)`
→ total = 8 → node = 8 → carry = 0
→ next = add(None, None, 0)

### Step 4:

Base case → return None.

Final Linked List: `7 -> 0 -> 8`

# 🧠 Pattern Identification

### Pattern type:

* **Linked List Recursion**
* **Digit-by-digit combination**
* **Carry-forward logic**

### When to think recursion:

* Each node’s output depends on the “next” node’s result.
* The problem feels *naturally repetitive* at each step.
* You can define a smaller version of the same problem:

  > “Add the rest of the list and then attach this digit.”

# 🧱 How to recognize the recursion pattern

| Clue in the question                            | Pattern                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The list represents a structure that repeats    | Linked list recursion      |
| Each node’s output depends on the next node’s   | Recursive dependency       |
| You could define the problem for a smaller list | Divide & conquer recursion |
| Carry/propagation logic (like addition)         | Perfect recursion example  |

# ⚙️ Interview-ready “explanation summary”

If you had to explain in one go:

> “Each node represents one digit.
> I add both digits and the carry, make a node for the result digit,
> and then recursively call the same function for the next nodes with the new carry.
> This continues until both lists and the carry are processed.
> In recursion, each function call builds one node and links to the result of the next addition.”

# ⚡ Complexity (same for both)

| Type              | Complexity   | Why                      |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Time              | O(max(m, n)) | Each node processed once |
| Space (Iterative) | O(1)         | Uses pointers only       |
| Space (Recursive) | O(max(m, n)) | Due to recursion stack   |

# 🧠 ADHD-friendly quick memory hook

💡 “Add Two Numbers” = “Add Digit + Carry, Move Next, Repeat”

If you can think:

> “Same logic repeats for next nodes”

→ you can turn it into recursion.
